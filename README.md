My name is Tim  
I live outside of Raeford, NC
I've a lifelong interested in electronics.
I have a ham license (K4SHF) and the FCC General Radiotelephone license (original was 1st class with radar)
I'm currently trying to learn Micropython, C++ and Assembly languages on a Raspberry Pi Pico microntroller (at the same time)
I do not currently have any projects in mind. I'm currently still trying to get familiar with Linux.
No collaberation is being sought, maybe some day.
Every day is a gift!
